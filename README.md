# smart-parking-system-api

It was made for a university project. 
A simple REST API, to get sensor data from Wemos microcontroller and update it in the database.
The sensor data represents if a parking place is busy or not.
Map coordinates are burned into the database.
Clients can access these coordinates with the sensor data, in order to look for free and closest parking places on the map.
